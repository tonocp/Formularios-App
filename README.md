# FormulariosApp

This is the GitHub repository for this project I made using **Angular** and **Bootstrap** as a *Forms App* example who validates the values given through *personal directives*, and also does it as a **Template Form**, a **Reactive Form**, and **Authentification** through **Form Group, FormBuilder and Validators** at **@angular/forms**, also using *personal services*. Even it's using **Async Validator** from **@angular/forms** to make a *http request* from a *JSON Database* that compares the database to check if the email exists already.

Right now is **still on development** and isn't deployed.
